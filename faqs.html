      <strong>What is a night at Flipside like?</strong>
      <p>A night at Flipside is an opportunity for you to unleash your inner creative. Choose what speaks to you: drawing live models? Creating pottery? Wielding a paintbrush? And, of course, we know a perfect night isn’t complete without your favourite bottle of wine — enjoy a glass (or two) while one of our artists takes you step-by-step through the process. Whether you’re a closet Monet or a daytime doodler, we provide everything you need for a relaxing, feel-good evening of bringing your imagination to life.</p>
