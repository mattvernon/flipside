      <h2>Ethos</h2>
      <p>At Flipside Studios, everyone is an artist. Our creative workshop space is founded on the understanding that extraordinary nights don’t come along all the time — they change. They inspire. They resonate. In classes run by our charismatic and talented instructors and tailored to your interests, spending your night tapping into your creative potential and honing past passions while discovering hidden ones. All with a glass of wine and friends, old and new, by your side.</p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Because we want you to flaunt your creativity. Because we believe in the power of kindling connections. Because we know everything is made better by a glass of wine. We created Flipside Studios because we’re passionate about your passion, and want you to have the space to nurture them. We refuse to settle for ordinary — and so should you. That’s why we’ve developed an environment where people can unleash their creativity, communities can be empowered, and friendships old and new can be strengthened. We think you deserve unforgettable nights with you, a canvas, and your imagination. At Flipside, we help unlock the artist in you. </p>
